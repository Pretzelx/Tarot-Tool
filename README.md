# Tarot Reading Tool

## Introduction
The Tarot Reading Tool is an interactive Python application that allows users to perform tarot card readings. It provides insights into different aspects of life based on the cards drawn. Users can choose between a Celtic Cross spread or a 3-card Past, Present, Future spread. This tool uses a comprehensive tarot deck to provide detailed interpretations of each card in both upright and reversed orientations.

## Understanding Tarot
Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each with its own imagery, symbolism, and story. It is divided into two main sections: **The Major Arcana** consists of 22 cards that represent significant life events, spiritual lessons, and karmic influences. These cards are numbered from 0 (The Fool) to 21 (The World) and are considered the core of the tarot deck. Each card in the Major Arcana has a profound meaning and reflects key archetypes or universal themes. **The Minor Arcana** consists of 56 cards divided into four suits: Cups, Pentacles, Swords, and Wands. Each suit contains 14 cards: ten numbered cards (Ace through Ten) and four court cards (Page, Knight, Queen, and King). The Minor Arcana cards provide more specific insights into day-to-day events and situations.

## Upright and Reversed Meanings
Each tarot card has both an upright and a reversed meaning, which changes depending on the orientation of the card when drawn:

- **Upright Meaning:** This is the traditional meaning of the card and often reflects the direct aspect of the card's symbolism.
- **Reversed Meaning:** When a card is drawn upside down, its meaning is altered, often reflecting the opposite aspect of the card's symbolism, or highlighting challenges and areas for growth.

## Tarot Spreads
### Celtic Cross Spread
The Celtic Cross is a ten-card spread that provides a detailed and comprehensive reading of a particular situation or question. Each position in the spread represents a different aspect:

1. **Present:** The current situation.
2. **Immediate Challenge:** The immediate obstacle or issue to be addressed.
3. **Distant Past:** Root causes or distant past influences.
4. **Recent Past:** Recent events or influences.
5. **Best Outcome:** The best possible outcome or solution.
6. **Immediate Future:** The immediate future or next steps.
7. **Factors Affecting Situation:** Internal factors affecting the situation.
8. **External Influences:** External factors or influences.
9. **Hopes and Fears:** Hopes, fears, or hidden emotions.
10. **Final Outcome:** The final outcome or resolution.

### 3-Card Spread (Past, Present, Future)
The 3-card spread is a simple yet effective spread to provide insights into a situation or question over time:

- **Past:** Influences or events from the past that affect the present situation.
- **Present:** The current state or circumstances.
- **Future:** Potential outcomes or future influences.

## Feature
- **Interactive Readings:** Users can choose between different spreads and enter card names and orientations for personalized readings.


## Further Information
- The initial datset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/tarot-json) which contains imagery and interpretations specifically of the [Rider-Waite Tarot deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) I added further columns according to what I saw fit, to build a comprehensive datset of tarot card meanings.
